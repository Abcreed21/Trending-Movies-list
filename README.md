This code consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. The HTML file contains the structure of the webpage, the CSS file contains the styling of the webpage, and the JavaScript file contains the logic of the webpage.

## Programming Language

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Logic Aspect

The HTML file contains the basic structure of the webpage, including the navigation bar, search bar, and movie row. The CSS file contains the styling of the webpage, including the background image, font, and color scheme. The JavaScript file contains the logic of the webpage, including fetching data from an API and dynamically creating movie cards based on the data.

The getMovie() function fetches data from the IMDB API and creates movie cards based on the data. The function first fetches data from the API using the fetch() method. Once the data is retrieved, the function clears the movie row and loops through the data to create a movie card for each item. Each movie card contains an image, title, and description.

## Limitations

The only downside of this code is that it uses a specific API address that may have limited use. If the API address becomes unavailable or changes, the code may not work properly.
